# System Description:

The system is a Smart Home Management Platform that allows users to remotely monitor and control their home devices. 
It supports different device types (e.g., lights, washing machines, ovens, thermostats, motion sensors, blinds, 
air conditioners, solar panels) and provides structured management through rooms and groups. 
The system integrates a database for persistence, exposes REST APIs for interaction, 
uses gRPC for communication with devices, and provides notifications for critical events (e.g., motion detected when the alarm is active).
A logging system stores all user and system actions, enabling monitoring and analysis of device activities.
The app also supports device automation, customizable configurations (e.g., temperature), and alarm functionality.

# User Stories:

US1: As a user, I want to manage all my home devices through the app, so that I can monitor and control them remotely.  

US2: As a developer, I want to connect a database to the system, so that all relevant data can be stored and queried.  

US3: As a user, I want to group devices by room, so that I can manage and monitor them in a structured way.  

US4: As a developer, I want to implement a user interface that provides access to all app functionalities, so that users can interact with the system easily.  

US5: As a user, I want to receive notifications when a device is active while I'm away, so that I can take corrective actions remotely.  

US6: As a user, I want to view the history of all actions in the app, so that I can keep track of what happens in my home.  

US7: As a user, I want to configure and start device programs from the app, so that I can automate tasks without manual interaction.  

US8: As a user, I want to set specific values (e.g., temperature) for configurable devices from the app, so that I can personalize their operation.  

US9: As a user, I want to enable an alarm mode with motion detection, so that I can be alerted of any intrusions when Iâ€™m away.  

US10: As a user, I want to create and manage device groups (e.g., light groups), so that I can control them collectively.
